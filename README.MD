Grind 75 is a LeetCode study plan created by the the author of the famous Blind 75.

The website itself starts off with 75 questions that covers all bases and expands up to 169 questions total for extra practice.
A lot of these questions also come from Sean Prashad's LeetCode Patterns list.

This is a log to keep track of my personal growth learning data structures and algorithms using JavaScript.
The goal is to thoroughly understand the base 75 questions, which should be enough to land an entry-level junior position.

Another objective is to have notes for each problem to help out anyone jumping into LeetCode for the first time.

My plan of action is as follows:

1. Attempt the LeetCode problem on my own. If I don't make any progress within 20 minutes..
2. Look over syntax resources and constructors for the given data structure and try to solve it from there for another 20 minutes or so.
3. If that doesn't help I'll research the solution to better understand how to tackle the problem.
4. Later on come back to the problem and try again.
