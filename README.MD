Neetcode is a LeetCode study plan created to master the basic patterns of data structures and algorithms.
The website itself consists of 150 questions that covers all bases.

This is a log to keep track of my personal growth learning data structures and algorithms using JavaScript.
The goal is to thoroughly understand each question and solution, which should be enough to land an entry-level developer position.

Another objective is to have notes for each problem to help out anyone jumping into LeetCode for the first time.

---

My plan of action is as follows:

1. Attempt the LeetCode problem on my own. If I don't make any progress within 20 minutes..
2. Look over hints, related syntax, and constructors for the given data structure and try to solve it from there for another 10 minutes or so.
3. If that doesn't help I'll research the solution to better understand how to tackle the problem.
4. Later on come back to the problem and try again.
